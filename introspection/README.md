 ### **Why must we choose you ?**
 
I am very much passionate about learning new technologies and I think this is the best platform to develop my skills. I gave my best in doing the tasks. Though I had no programming background I strived hard to complete as many tasks as possible with perfection. This journey of mine doing the tasks had taught me many things and I wish to continue the same even after entering into the club. I love to constantly learn and I am pretty sure that amfoss is the perfect place for that.

 ### **What is your plan for the next 6 months ?**
 
Giving my best in strengthening my skills and spending my time and effort as much as possible in the club along with maintaining good CGPA.

 ### **How would you contribute back to the club ?**
 
I will try by all means to put myself involved into the club. I would also like to transfer the knowledge gained by me to my juniors and help many enthusiasts like me. Like our seniors doing now I would also like to actively participate in the recruitment process and help in recruting the deserving members.

### **Do you have any feedback for the selection process ?**

The tasks were a bit challenging at the beginning atleast for me as I am from a non-CS background. But I learnt quite a lot of things in this process. As far as I know the main motive of selection process is to select the deserving candidates who are ready to learn and put maximum effort. But finally I feel very much satisfied about the knowledge I have gained in this process.
