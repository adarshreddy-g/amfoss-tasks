#  Ubiquitous UI

## Installation
* I have installed [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows) and [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=CjwKCAiA-_L9BRBQEiwA-bm5fk-JSA_8iQqCK-_OP3EiVKPMApf058MpMbDpyoZHYYee5VDrmTGTjhoCa04QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).
* By following the steps given in the flutter website the installation was easily done.


## Procedure Followed
* I have no idea about dart or flutter before starting the task then I learnt some basics of dart and proceeded with the task.
* As dart is a object oriented programming language I needed to learn a few things about classes.
* This task was a bit challenging at the beginning. I have divided the task into sub tasks like adding images, making the pages slide etc. But as I have progressed through the task I got a bit more familiar with the task.
* There is a lot of documentation for flutter. It was very much useful for me.
* I have seen the sample UI and tried to create the UI same as that.
* Out of everything adding the dots indicator was a bit tough. By watching some tutorials and reading the documentation I have added the dots indicator successfully.

### adding a button
This part was easy. I just googled on how to add a button and I found documentation on making it in a sizedbox and adding the padding around it.
### Creating pages
I have created two pages by using pageview.
### Adding images
I have downloaded the images provided. At first I was confused that why 1x,2x,3x images are given where I thought only 1x will be enough. So as I started adding the assets the images were not aligning properly, then I tried using the 2x and 3x images then I made them align perfectly.
### adding the dots indicator
This was the most difficult part of this task for me. It is the most time taking part too. But at last by googling about it I imported the dots indicator library and made it work.
### Page responsiveness
I have tried to add the page responsiveness as suggested by my mentor but I am not sure whether I have done it perfectly.
I have used mediaquery which gives the length and width of the screen, hence all other parameters will be adjusted according to the dimensions.

* This is one of my favourite task in the list.
