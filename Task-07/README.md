#  Ubiquitous UI

## Installation
* I have installed [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/windows) and [android studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=CjwKCAiA-_L9BRBQEiwA-bm5fk-JSA_8iQqCK-_OP3EiVKPMApf058MpMbDpyoZHYYee5VDrmTGTjhoCa04QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).
* By following the steps given in the flutter website the installation was easily done.


## Procedure Followed
* I have learnt some basics of dart.
* As dart is a object oriented programming language I needed to learn a few things about classes.
* This task was a bit challenging at the beginning. I have divided the task into sub tasks like adding images, making the pages slide etc. But as I have progressed through the task I got a bit more familiar with the task.
* There is a lot of documentation for flutter. It was very much useful for me.
* Out of everything adding the dots indicator was a bit tough. By watching some tutorials and reading the documentation I have added the dots indicator successfully.
