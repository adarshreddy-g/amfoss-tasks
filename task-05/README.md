## Rustic Scraper

### Task
The task is to write a rust script that scrapes information from [worldmeters.info](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries) and write it into a csv file.


* This task was very much challenging as there are literally very few resources about web scraping in rust.
* I have found a two or three blogs about scraping and a video about rust.
* I have tried to learn some basics of rust. But seriously this was a very different language.
* I have written some code and found some relatated resources in some websites.
* Finally I have made the program to scrape the info from the website to terminal.
* But then came the real challenge to write it into a csv file. I thought it would be an easy job like appending the commits to a JSON file in the perceval task. But I was wrong.
* Finally after a lot of struggle the info was writing into a csv file.
* But the data was not neatly organized like in a table. It just got printed in a same line.
* But Finally I was able to get the data in a CSV file.
