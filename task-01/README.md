 # **Starring amFOSS repositories**

## Procedure

* I have signed into my github account.

* Copied the entire script in [star.user.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amfoss/star-me/master/star.user.js).

* Opened the console tab in the developer tools.
    * It can be opened by pressing **ctrl+shift+i** simultaneously.
 
* I have then pasted the entire script copied earlier in the console tab and pressed enter.

* It took a few seconds for the execution.

* After execution a text **It's done** is showed in the console itself.
