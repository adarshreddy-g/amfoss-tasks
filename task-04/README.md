# Debugging Derbies

#### To get the code run the following command in the terminal
`$ wget -O MathQuiz.java http://tiny.cc/amfoss-task4`

* There were some syntactical errors like missing semicolon etc in the code.
* The code ran successfully after fixing the errors.
* But there were some functional errors like when i hit the stop button,start button triggers and vice versa.
* Arithmetic operators were written wrong in the code. after fixing them add,substract,multiplication and division worked perfectly.
* Fixed the errors by reading the comments and most of the functions were functioning right.
* Finally, the Mathquiz worked perfectly.
