# Debugging Derbies

### Task
The task is to find out all the bugs in the given java code and fix them.

### Installation

* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) can be installed by executing the following command
` sudo apt install default-jre `
* JRE is helpful to run Java softwares.
* Then I have installed Java Development Kit(JDK), It is also helpful to run Java softwares.
` sudo apt install default-jdk `

#### To get the code run the following command in the terminal
`$ wget -O MathQuiz.java http://tiny.cc/amfoss-task4`

### Procedure
* When I ran the code for the first time there were some syntactical errors like missing semicolon etc in the code.
* I have fixed the syntatical errors and ran the program. There were some functional errors too like when i click the stop button,start button triggers and vice versa.
* Arithmetic operators were written wrong in the code. after fixing them add,substract,multiplication and division worked perfectly.
* The time displaying was not right, then I have converted the milliseconds to seconds by following some basic math.
* I used the search option to find the position of the required function in the code.
* I have fixed most of the errors by reading the comments and most of the functions were functioning right.
* Finally, the Mathquiz worked perfectly.
* Task was quite easy and interesting.
