 ### **Why must we choose you ?**
 
I am very much passionate about learning new technologies and I think this is the best platform to develop my skills. I gave my 100 percent in doing the tasks. Though I had no programming background I strived hard to complete as many tasks as possible with perfection. This journey of mine doing the tasks had taught me many things and I wish to continue the same and keep myself updated.


 ### **What is your plan for the next 6 months ?**
 
Giving my best in strengthening my skills and spending my time and effort as much as possible in the club along with maintaining good CGPA.

 ### **How would you contribute back to the club ?**
 
I will try by all means to put myself involved into the club. I would also like to transfer the knowledge gained to my juniors and help many enthusiasts like me. Like our seniors doing now I would also like to actively participate in the recruitment process and help in recruting the deserving members.

### **Do you have any feedback for the selection process ?**

The tasks were a bit challenging at the beginning atleast for me as I am from a non-cs background. But I learnt quite a lot of things in this process. For few of the hackerrank problems there are time restrictions so eventhough I was getting the required output program is getting terminated due to runtime error. Since I am just in the beginning, optimization of time was a problem. So in my opinion it would be better if there are no time constraints. Also the events and interactions held by the seniors were very helpful.
