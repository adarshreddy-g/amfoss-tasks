 **Why must we choose you ?**
I am very much passionate about learning new technologies and I think this is the best platform for me to develop my skills. I gave my 100 percent in doing the tasks. Though I had no programming background I strived hard to complete as many tasks with perfection. This journey of mine doing the tasks had taught me many things and I hope to continue the same and keep myself updated.



 **What is your plan for the next 6 months ?**
Giving my best in strengthening my skills and spending my time and effort as much as possible in the club, By also maintaining a descent CGPA.

 **How would you contribute back to the club ?**
I will try by all means to put my time and effort in the club and I would also like to pass my knowledge and help people. Like our seniors doing now I would also like to actively participate in the recruitment process and help in recruting the deserving members.

**Do you have any feedback for the selection process ?**
The tasks were a bit challenging at the beginning atleast for me as I am from a non-cs background. But I learnt quite a lot of things in this process. For few of the hackerrank problems there are time restrictions so eventhough I was getting the required output program is getting terminated due to runtime error. Since I am just in the beginning, optimization of time was a problem. So In my opinion it would be better if there are no time constraints. Also the events and interactions held by the seniors were very helpful.
