 #TASK 0
I have downloaded the iso file of ubuntu from Ubuntu.Com. 
The version which I downloaded was 20.04.1 LTS.
Then with the aid of balenaEtcher I have burned the .iso file into an usb drive.
I have created a partition in the storage of my pc for linux which can be done in disk management.
Then I rebooted the pc and went into bios menu and changed the booting order and selected the first preference as usb drive in which ubuntu was burned in.
I have followed the onscreen instructions and the installation have started.
But at the end of the installation an error popped out that my bitlocker was enabled.
So I have again booted back into windows and disabled the bitlocker.
Then the installation have completed successfully.


Problems Encountered: I've encountered a problem because of the bitlocker which was resolved by disabling the bitlocker.
